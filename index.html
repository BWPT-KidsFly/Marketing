          <h1>Is This You?</h1>
          <p>
            Is this you? Any parent who has dreamed of traveling, shutters at
            the thought of bringing their children on a plane. The thought of
            just entering the airport and getting through bag check and security
            without losing a child or two seems impossible. How is one parent
            supposed to carry children, luggage, stroller, car seat, diaper and
            carry on bags. Oh don’t forget your passports either. But fret no
            more, KidsFly is here. KidsFly is going to make traveling with
            children a breeze.

          <h1>The Kidsfly Experience</h1>
          <p>
            So imagine you are on your way to the airport, it’s a simple as a
            click of the button. Now your personal KidsFly staff member, Sarah
            can estimate your arrival and meet you curbside. Sarah grabs your
            luggage and walks you to airport security. She helps entertain the
            children as you wait in line. After security Sarah helps with
            luggage and keeps an eye on the children as you walk towards your
            gate. Sarah comes prepared with healthy snacks, juices, portable dvd
            player and coloring activities. This keeps your children preoccupied
            as they wait till boarding begins. Then finally after a long but
            peaceful trip through the airport it is time to board. The
            experience doesn’t stop here. Last but definitely not least Sarah is
            here to help you board the plane and get your children seated.
