        <h2>Is this you?</h2>
        <p>Any parent who has dreamed of traveling, shutters at the thought of bringing their children on a plane. The thought of just entering the airport and getting through bag check and security without losing a child or two seems impossible. How is one parent supposed to carry children, luggage,  stroller, car seat, diaper and carry on bags. Oh don’t forget your passports either. But fret no more, <span class="bold">KidsFly</span> is here. <span class="bold">KidsFly</span> is going to make traveling with children a breeze.</p>

        <h2>The Kidsfly experience</h2>
        <p>So imagine you are on your way to the airport, and all you have ot do is tap a button. Now your personal KidsFly staff member, Sarah, can estimate your arrival and meet you curbside. Sarah grabs your luggage and walks you to airport security. She helps entertain the children as you wait in line. After security Sarah helps with luggage and keeps an eye on the children as you walk towards your gate. Sarah comes prepared with healthy snacks, juices, portable dvd player and coloring activities. This keeps your children preoccupied as they wait till  boarding begins. Then finally after a long but peaceful trip through the airport it is time to board. The experience doesn’t stop here. Last but definitely not least Sarah is here to help you board the plane and get your children seated.</p>
