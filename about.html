        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>KidsFly was created out of necessity. As parents traveling with young kids, we knew that there had to be a better way to travel. We would have to haul all our our luggage, 3 or three car seats, and all of our travel documents. All the while, trying to keep all of our kids entertained. <br/>
        Do you feel the same? We created KidsFly for parents just like us, who love to travel but wish it was easier for to travel with the kiddos. We have partnered with airlines and airports to help you travel to your destination with happy kids. <br/>
        Our "Travel Friends" will walk with you from curbside drop-off, introduce themselves to your family, then help assure that the check-in process goes smoothly. Once at the gate, your "Travel Friend" will have an assortment of travel sized board games to play with your kids (and you, if you'd like to join in).
